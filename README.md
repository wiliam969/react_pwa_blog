# React PWA Blog
This project is based on the create-react-app.
You can use it as a fixed Portfolio Template.
Just set some params in the .env file and you can call a WP API. 
With a little hassle it would be possible to integrate other API's.

## TODO (beta brach)
* ~~Generalize the API~~.

    Generalize it even more so you only have to edit the api class
   
* Merge blog and project cause they are the same just with other params
* Refactor the Lazyload function in order to load stuff more general
* Create a global wrapper for sites as "aboutme", "imprint", "privacy"
* Integrate Offline Support 
* integrate category support for blog+projects+gallery
* create more modules for 'home'
* capsule modules and only call reference them in the respective url
* create nice animation 
* create global modul for the userinteraction e.g. fetching,loading etc. 
* Use: https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS
* Use: https://github.com/craigcosmo/babel-plugin-react-css-modules (better css loading)
* Use: https://github.com/trainline/react-skeletor (for better UX)
