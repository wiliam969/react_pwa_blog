# React PWA Blog
This project is based on the create-react-app. 
Set some params in the .env file and you can call a WP API. 
With a little hassle it would be possible to integrate other API's.

##TODO
* Merge blog and project cause they are the same just with other params
* Create a global wrapper for sites as "aboutme", "impressum", datenschutzerkl√§rung"
* Integrate Offline Support 
* integrate cat support for blog+projects
* Use: https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect
